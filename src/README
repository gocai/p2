Modifications for mcts_modified.py: In the vanilla mcts, the rollout function grabs a random legal action,
calls next state with that action, and continues forward until the an end state is reached. In our modified
mcts, rather than grabbing an action at random, we check the current number of owned boxes of each player,
then check through each legal action call next state with that action, then we check the number of owned
boxes again and if the action resulted in one player's number of owned boxes increasing then we go with that
state, and if no actions lead to an increase in owned boxes then we grab an action at random. This should
improve the mcts algorithm by selecting better action pathways in the rollout, where normally the action chosen
is random, we instead grab one that completes a box, if it exists, as this gets the player who's turn it is
into a better position by securing a box, and therefore is a more optimal path of actions when seeking which
set of moves is best.
